# EchoUI ios ‚Äî simple frotend LLM app for iOS

This application was written in order to transfer the character of AI and so on experience to open source. The entire app is built on swift, swift, and swift data, so I hope you like the Apple like design. I tried to scatter the code in intuitive folders and make it readable so that you can freely customize it and see the functions.



## ‚ú® Features:

+ The following functions are available::
+ Character Creation
+ Creating a persona

(That is, a photo, a description of the character as a system prompt, a character greeting)
+ Markdown markup in messages
+ The chat history is saved
